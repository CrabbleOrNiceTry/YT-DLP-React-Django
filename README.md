# YT-DLP-React-Django

This is a Youtube to mp4 webapp using React + Bootstrap as the frontend and django as the backend. 

# YT-DLP

We are using the YT-DLP python package to extract Youtube videos. To save bandwidth, rather than downloading the videos to the server and uploading them, 
we use the pre-extracted download links provided by youtube-dlp.
